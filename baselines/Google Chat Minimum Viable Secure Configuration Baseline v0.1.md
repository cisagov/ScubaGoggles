# CISA Google Workspace Security Configuration Baseline for Google Chat

Google Chat is a communication and collaboration tool in Google Workspace that supports direct messaging, group conversations, and content creation and sharing. Chat allows administrators to control and manage their messages and files. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen Chat security.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project provides guidance and capabilities to secure agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments. The SCuBA Secure Configuration Baselines (SCB) for Google Workspace (GWS) will help secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) information assets stored within GWS cloud environments through consistent, effective, modern, and manageable security configurations.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for GWS help secure federal information assets stored within GWS cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance with the knowledge that every organization has different threat models and risk tolerance. Non-governmental organizations may also find value in applying these baselines to reduce risks.

Any reference to specific commercial entities or commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation, or favoritism by CISA.

This baseline is based on Google documentation available at [Google Workspace Admin Help: Google Chat settings](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9540647?hl=en) and addresses the following:

-   [Chat History](#1-chat-history)
-   [External File Sharing](#2-external-file-sharing)
-   [History for Spaces](#3-history-for-spaces)
-   [External Chat Messaging](#4-external-chat-messaging)
-   [Installation of Chat Apps](#5-installation-of-chat-apps)
-   [DLP Rules](#6-dlp-rules)
-   [Content Reporting](#7-content-reporting)

Settings can be assigned to certain users within Google Workspace through organizational units, configuration groups, or individually. Before changing a setting, the user can select the organizational unit, configuration group, or individual users to which they want to apply changes.

This section covers whether chat history is retained by default for users within the organization. This control does not apply for threaded chat spaces because those require that history be on, which cannot be changed. Chat spaces allow for multiple users to share files, assign tasks, and stay connected.

### Policies

#### GWS.CHAT.3.1v0.1
Space history SHOULD be enabled for traceability of information.

- _Rationale:_ Users engaged in Google Chat may inadvertently share sensitive or private information during conversations. Details discussed in chats may be crucial for future reference or dispute resolution. Enabling chat history for Google Chat may mitigate these risks by providing a traceable record of all conversations, enhancing information accountability and security.

5.  Select **SAVE**.

## 6. DLP rules

This recommendation applies only to agencies that allow external sharing (see section 2.1).

Using data loss prevention (DLP), organizations can create and apply rules to control the content that users can share in files outside the organization. DLP gives you control over what users can share and prevents unintended exposure of sensitive information.

DLP rules can use predefined content detectors to match PII (e.g., SSN), credentials (e.g., API keys), or specific document types (e.g., source code). Custom rules can also be applied based upon regex match or document labels.

### Policies

#### GWS.CHAT.6.1v0.1
Agencies SHOULD configure DLP rules to block or warn on sharing files with sensitive data.

- _Rationale:_ Data Loss Prevention (DLP) rules help identify and limit the sharing of sensitive content, protecting agency information. By blocking and/or having warnings on these DLP-scanned files from being shared with users, the risk of unintentional introduction of sensitive content is reduced.
