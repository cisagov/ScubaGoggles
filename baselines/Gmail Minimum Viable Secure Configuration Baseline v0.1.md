# CISA Google Workspace Security Configuration Baseline for Gmail

Gmail is the Google Workspace offering for sending and receiving email. Users can upload attachments to emails and send them to a given email address. Additional Gmail features include integrating with other Google applications, such as Meet and Chat. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen Gmail security.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project provides guidance and capabilities to secure agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments. The SCuBA Secure Configuration Baselines (SCB) for Google Workspace (GWS) will help secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) information assets stored within GWS cloud environments through consistent, effective, modern, and manageable security configurations.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for GWS help secure federal information assets stored within GWS cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance with the knowledge that every organization has different threat models and risk tolerance. Non-governmental organizations may also find value in applying these baselines to reduce risks.

# Baseline Policies

## 1. Mail Delegation

This section determines whether users can delegate access to their mailbox to others within the same domain. This delegation includes access to read, send, and delete messages on the account owner's behalf. This delegation can be done via a command line tool (GAM) if enabled in the admin console.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.1.1v0.1
Mail Delegation SHOULD be disabled.

- _Rationale:_ Granting mail delegation can inadvertently lead to disclosure of sensitive information, impersonation of delegated accounts, or malicious alteration or deletion of emails. By controlling mail delegation, these risks can be significantly reduced, ensuring the security and integrity of email communications.
- _Last modified:_ October 4, 2023
- _Note:_ Exceptions should be limited to individuals authorized by existing Agency policy, such as SES or Politically Appointed staff. Other considerations include ensuring that delegated accounts require Phishing-Resistant Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), limiting delegated account permissions (ex. allowing view/reply but not delete), monitoring delegated accounts regularly, and disabling them if no longer required.

### Prerequisites

-   None

### Implementation

#### GWS.GMAIL.1.1v0.1 Instructions
To configure the settings for Mail Delegation:
1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Apps -\> Google Workspace -\> Gmail**.
3.  Select **User Settings -\> Mail delegation**.
4.  Ensure that the **Let users delegate access to their mailbox to other users in the domain** checkbox is unchecked.
5.  Select **Save**.


## 2. DomainKeys Identified Mail

This section enables DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to help prevent spoofing on outgoing messages sent from a specific domain. DKIM allows digital signatures to be added to email messages in the message header, providing a layer of both authenticity and integrity to emails. Without DKIM, messages that are sent from a specific domain are more likely to be marked as spam by receiving mail servers. DKIM relies on Domain Name System (DNS) records, thus, its deployment depends on how an agency manages its DNS.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.2.1v0.1
DKIM SHOULD be enabled for all domains.

- _Rationale:_ Enabling DKIM for all domains can help prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks. Without DKIM, adversaries could manipulate email headers to appear as if they're from a legitimate source, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. By enabling DKIM, the authenticity of emails can be verified, reducing this risk.

### Prerequisites

-   None

### Implementation

#### GWS.GMAIL.2.1v0.1 Instructions
To configure the settings for DKIM:
1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Apps -\> Google Workspace -\> Gmail**.
3.  Select **Authenticate email -\> DKIM authentication**.
4.  Select a domain listed in the **Selected** domain drop-down menu.
5.  Select **START AUTHENTICATION**.
6.  Select **Save**.
7.  Add the DNS TXT record listed in Admin Console to the domain, via the domain provider's DNS settings page. Note that it can take up to 48 hours for DNS changes to fully propagate.

Note that step 7 requires action taken outside of the Google Admin Console, dependent on the agency's domain provider. Thus, the exact final step needed to set up DKIM varies from agency to agency. See [Turn on DKIM for your domain](https://support.google.com/a/answer/180504) for more details.

To test your DKIM configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as the [Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/).

## 3. Sender Policy Framework

The Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a mechanism that allows administrators to specify which IP addresses are explicitly approved to send email on behalf of the domain, facilitating detection of spoofed emails. SPF isn't configured through the Google Admin Console, but rather via DNS records hosted by the agency's domain. Thus, the exact steps needed to set up SPF varies from agency to agency, but Google's documentation provides some helpful starting points.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.3.1v0.1
An SPF policy SHALL be published for each domain that fails all non-approved senders.

- _Rationale:_ Adversaries could potentially manipulate the 'FROM' field in an email to appear as a legitimate sender, increasing the risk of phishing attacks. By publishing an SPF policy for each domain that fails all non-approved senders, this risk can be reduced as it provides a means to detect and block such deceptive emails. Additionally, SPF is required for federal, executive branch, departments and agencies by Binding Operational Directive 18-01, "Enhance Email and Web Security."
- _Last modified:_ February 14, 2024
- _Note:_ SPF defines two different "fail" mechanisms: fail (indicated by `-`, sometimes referred to as hardfail) and softail (indicated by `~`). Fail, as used in this baseline policy, refers to hardfail (i.e., `-`).

-   [Google Workspace Admin Help: Help prevent spoofing and spam with SPF](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786#to-do)

### Prerequisites
-   A list of approved IP addresses for sending mail must be maintained. Failing to maintain an accurate list of authorized IP addresses may result in spoofed email messages or failure to deliver legitimate messages when SPF is enabled. Maintaining such a list helps ensure that unauthorized servers sending spoofed messages can be detected, and permits message delivery from legitimate senders.

### Implementation

#### GWS.GMAIL.3.1v0.1 Instructions
First, identify any approved senders specific to your agency (see [Identify all email senders for your organization](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10686639#senders) for tips). SPF allows you to indicate approved senders by IP address or CIDR range. However, note that SPF allows you to [include](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-5.2) the IP addresses indicated by a separate SPF policy, refered to by domain name. See [Define your SPF record—Basic setup](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10685031) for inclusions required for Google to send email on behalf of your domain.

SPF is not configured through the Google Workspace admin center, but rather via DNS records hosted by the agency's domain. Thus, the exact steps needed to set up SPF varies from agency to agency. See [Add your SPF record at your domain provider](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10684623) for more details.

To test your SPF configuration, consider using a web-based tool, such as the [Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/).  Additionally, SPF records can be requested using the command line tool `dig`. For example:
```
dig example.com txt
```
If SPF is configured, a response resembling `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com -all` will be returned; though by necessity, the contents of the SPF policy may vary by agency. In this example, the SPF policy indicates the IP addresses listed by the policy for "_spf.google.com" are the only approved senders for "example.com." These IPs can be determined via additional SPF lookups, starting with "_spf.google.com."

Ensure the IP addresses listed as approved senders for your domains are correct. Additionally, ensure that each policy either ends in `-all` or [redirects](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208#section-6.1) to one that does; this directive indicates that all IPs that don't match the policy should fail. See [Define your SPF record—Advanced setup](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10683907) for a more in-depth discussion of SPF record syntax.

## 4. Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance


Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) works with SPF and DKIM to authenticate mail senders and ensure that destination email systems can validate messages sent from your domain. DMARC helps receiving mail systems determine what to do with messages sent from your domain that fail SPF or DKIM checks.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.4.1v0.1
A DMARC policy SHALL be published for every second-level domain.

- _Rationale:_ Without proper authentication and a DMARC policy available for each domain, recipients may improperly handle SPF and DKIM failures, possibly enabling adversaries to send deceptive emails that appear to be from your domain. By publishing a DMARC policy for every second-level domain, this risk can be reduced by publishing how authentication failures should be handled. 
- _Last modified:_ November 13, 2023

- MITRE ATT&CK TTP Mapping
  - None

#### GWS.GMAIL.4.2v0.1
The DMARC message rejection option SHALL be p=reject.

- _Rationale:_ Without stringent email authentication, adversaries could potentially send deceptive emails that appear to be from your domain, increasing the risk of phishing attacks. This policy reduces risk as it ensures that emails failing SPF or DKIM checks are automatically rejected, preventing potentially harmful emails from reaching recipients. Additionally, "reject" is the level of protection required by BOD 18-01, "Enhance Email and Web Security," for federal, executive branch, departments and agencies.

#### GWS.GMAIL.4.3v0.1
The DMARC point of contact for aggregate reports SHALL include `reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov`.

- _Rationale:_ Without a centralized point of contact for DMARC aggregate reports, potential email security issues may go unnoticed, increasing the risk of phishing attacks. By including reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov as the DMARC point of contact, this risk can be reduced by ensuring a streamlined process for CISA to monitor and address email authentication issues, enhancing overall email security as required by BOD 18-01 for federal, executive branch, departments and agencies.

- _Rationale:_ Without a designated agency point of contact for DMARC aggregate and failure reports, potential email security issues may not be promptly addressed, increasing the risk of phishing attacks. By including an agency point of contact, this risk can be reduced as it facilitates a timely response to email authentication issues, enhancing overall email security.

### Prerequisites

-   DKIM or SPF must be enabled

### Implementation

#### GWS.GMAIL.4.1v0.1 Instructions
DMARC is not configured through the Google Admin Console, but rather via DNS records hosted by the agency's domain(s). As such, implementation varies depending on how an agency manages its DNS records. See [Add your DMARC record](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466563) for Google guidance.

Note, a DMARC record published at the second-level domain will protect all subdomains. In other words, a DMARC record published for `example.com` will protect both `a.example.com` and `b.example.com`, but a separate record would need to be published for `c.example.gov`.

To test your DMARC configuration, consider using one of many publicly available web-based tools, such as the [Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/). Additionally, DMARC records can be requested using the command line tool `dig`. For example:

```
dig _dmarc.example.com txt
```

If DMARC is configured, a response resembling `v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100; rua=mailto:reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov, mailto:reports@example.com; ruf=mailto:reports@example.com` will be returned, though by necessity, the contents of the record will vary by agency. In this example, the policy indicates all emails failing the SPF/DKIM checks are to be rejected and aggregate reports sent to reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov and reports@example.com. Failure reports will be sent to reports@example.com.

#### GWS.GMAIL.4.2v0.1 Instructions
See [GWS.GMAIL.4.1v1](#gwsgmail41v01-instructions) instructions for an overview of how to publish and check a DMARC record. Ensure the record published includes `p=reject`.

#### GWS.GMAIL.4.3v0.1 Instructions
See [GWS.GMAIL.4.1v1](#gwsgmail41v01-instructions) instructions for an overview of how to publish and check a DMARC record. Ensure the record published includes reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov as one of the emails for the `rua` field.

#### GWS.GMAIL.4.4v0.1 Instructions
See [GWS.GMAIL.4.1v1](#gwsgmail41v01-instructions) instructions for an overview of how to publish and check a DMARC record. Ensure the record published includes a point of contact specific to your agency, in addition to reports@dmarc.cyber.dhs.gov, as one of the emails for the `rua` field and one or more agency-defined points of contact for the `ruf` field.

## 5. Attachment Protections

This section enables protections against suspicious attachments and scripts from untrusted senders, to include encrypted attachments, documents with malicious scripts, and attachment file types that are uncommon and/or archaic. Through these attachments malware can be spread. These messages can be kept in the inbox with a warning label (default), moved to spam, or quarantined.

A Google Workspace solution is not strictly required to satisfy this baseline control, but the solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to those offered by Google.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.5.1v0.1
Protect against encrypted attachments from untrusted senders SHALL be enabled.

- _Rationale:_ Attachments from untrusted senders, especially encrypted ones, may contain malicious content that poses a security risk. By enabling protection against encrypted attachments from untrusted senders, this risk can be reduced, enhancing the safety and integrity of user data and systems.

## 6. Links and External Images Protection

This section enables extra protections to prevent email phishing due to links and external images. Specific settings for this control include identifying hidden malicious links behind shortened URLs, scanning linked images to find hidden malicious content, showing a warning prompt when clicking links to untrusted domains, and applying future recommended settings automatically.

A Google Workspace solution is not strictly required to satisfy this baseline control, but the solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to those offered by Google.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.6.1v0.1
Identify links behind shortened URLs SHALL be enabled.

- _Rationale:_ Shortened URLs can potentially hide malicious links, posing a security risk. By enabling the identification of links behind shortened URLs, this risk can be reduced, enhancing the safety and integrity of user data and systems.

### Prerequisites

-   N/A

### Implementation

To configure the settings for Per-user Outbound Gateways:

#### GWS.GMAIL.12.1v0.1 Instructions
1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Apps -\> Google Workspace -\> Gmail**.
3.  Select **End User Access -\> Allow per-user outbound gateways**.
4.  Uncheck the **Allow users to send mail through an external SMTP server when configuring a "from" address hosted outside your email domain** checkbox.

## 13. Unintended External Reply Warning

This section determines whether users are prompted with a warning for messages that include external recipients (users with emails addresses that are outside of your organization). However, the warning is not shown if the external recipient is in the organization's Directory, personal Contacts, or other Contacts; or if a secondary domain or domain alias address is used.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.13.1v0.1
Unintended external reply warnings SHALL be enabled to avoid unintentional replies and remind users to treat external messages with caution.

- _Rationale:_ Without unintended external reply warnings, users may inadvertently reply to external messages, potentially exposing sensitive information. By enabling these warnings, users are reminded to treat external messages with caution, reducing this risk and enhancing the safety and integrity of user data and systems.

## 14. Email Allowlist

This section determines whether an email allowlist allows for messages from certain IP addresses to not be marked as spam by Gmail. However, if implemented, emails from these senders will bypass important security mechanisms, such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.14.1v0.1
An email allowlist SHOULD not be implemented.

- _Rationale:_ Implementing an email allowlist could potentially expose users to security risks as allowlisted senders bypass important security mechanisms, including spam filtering and sender authentication checks. By not implementing an allowlist, this risk can be reduced, enhancing the safety and integrity of the user data and systems.

## 15. Enhanced Pre-Delivery Message Scanning

This section determines whether Gmail can screen and identify suspicious content that may be phishing attempts. In doing so, Google can either show a warning or move the email to Spam, but email delivery will experience a short delay due to the additional checks.

A Google Workspace solution is not strictly required to satisfy this baseline control, but the solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to those offered by Google.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.15.1v0.1
Enhanced pre-delivery message scanning SHALL be enabled to prevent phishing.

- _Rationale:_ Without enhanced pre-delivery message scanning, users may be exposed to phishing attempts, posing a security risk. By enabling this feature, potential phishing emails can be identified and blocked before reaching the user, reducing this risk and enhancing the safety and integrity of user data and systems.

## 16. Security Sandbox

This section determines whether certain messages and their associated attachments are executed in a sandbox environment for protection against malware, ransomware, and zero-day threats. Malicious software may be missed by traditional antivirus programs. However, this may cause some messages to get delayed before final delivery. Some of the file types scanned include Microsoft executables, Microsoft Office, PDF, and archives (zip, rar).

A Google Workspace solution is not strictly required to satisfy this baseline control, but the solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to those offered by Google.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.16.1v0.1
Security sandbox SHOULD be enabled to provide additional protections for their email messages.

- _Rationale:_ Without a security sandbox, any emails with malicious content could potentially interact directly with the users' systems, posing a risk. By enabling the security sandbox, additional protections are provided for email messages, reducing this risk and enhancing the safety and integrity of user data and systems.

## 17. Comprehensive Mail Storage

This section allows for email messages sent through other Google Workspace applications, (i.e., Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, Forms, and Keep) to be stored in the associated users' Gmail mailboxes. This includes a copy of all sent or received messages within a specified domain (including messages sent or received by non-Gmail mailboxes).

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.17.1v0.1
Comprehensive mail storage SHOULD be enabled to allow tracking of information across applications.

- _Rationale:_ Without comprehensive mail storage, tracking of information across applications could be compromised, posing a potential security risk. By enabling comprehensive mail storage, this risk can be reduced, enhancing the safety and integrity of user data and systems.

## 18. Content Compliance Filtering

This section determines whether Gmail content is filtered based upon specified expressions, such as keyword, strings or patterns, and metadata. The compliance actions based upon the word lists are reject, quarantine, or deliver with modifications.

A Google Workspace solution is not strictly required to satisfy this baseline control, but the solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to those offered by Google.

### Policies

#### GWS.GMAIL.18.1v0.1
Content filtering SHOULD be enabled within Gmail messages.

- _Rationale:_ Without content filtering, Gmail messages could potentially contain sensitive or private content, posing a security risk. By enabling content filtering, this risk can be reduced, enhancing the safety and integrity of user data and systems.
