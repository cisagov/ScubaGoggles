# CISA Google Workspace Security Configuration Baseline for Google Sites

Google Sites is a collaborative tool in Google Workspace that supports the creation of websites (i.e., internal project hubs, team sites, and public-facing websites) without the need of a designer, programmer, or IT help. Sites allow administrators to control and manage their files and documents. Google Drive manages sharing and publishing settings for new Sites. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen Sites security.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project provides guidance and capabilities to secure agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments. The SCuBA Secure Configuration Baselines (SCB) for Google Workspace (GWS) will help secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) information assets stored within GWS cloud environments through consistent, effective, modern, and manageable security configurations.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for GWS help secure federal information assets stored within GWS cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance with the knowledge that every organization has different threat models and risk tolerance. Non-governmental organizations may also find value in applying these baselines to reduce risks.

This baseline is based on Google documentation available at [Google Workspace Admin Help: Sites](https://support.google.com/a/topic/6385920?hl=en&ref_topic=9197) and addresses the following:

-   [Sites Service Status](#1-sites-service-status)

Google is currently transitioning from classic Sites to new Sites, [Google Workspace Admin Help: Transition from classic Sites to new Sites](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9958187?hl=en&ref_topic=25684#zippy=%2Cstarting-july-previously-january-classic-sites-transition%2Cstarting-june-previously-december-editing-of-remaining-classic-sites-will-be-disabled). Starting December 1, 2022, classic Sites will no longer be editable. And starting January 1, 2023, classic Sites will no longer be viewable unless converted to new Google Sites. All remaining classic Sites will be automatically archived as HTML files, saved to the site owner's Google Drive, and replaced with a draft in new Sites to be reviewed and published.

Settings can be assigned to certain users within Google Workspace through organizational units, configuration groups, or individually. Before changing a setting, the user can select the organizational unit, configuration group, or individual users to which they want to apply changes.
