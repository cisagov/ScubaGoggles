# CISA Google Workspace Secure Configuration Baseline for Google Classroom

Google Classroom is a service to streamline assignments, boost collaboration, and foster communication. This service allows for the creation of classes, creating and grading assignments, student collaboration, communication with teachers and students, and integration with other Google products.

Google Classroom is designed and intended for implementation for Education Institutions. Google Classroom is available with the Google Workspace for Education Edition, and is included with all tiers of GWS for Education including Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus. CISA's Secure Configuration Baseline Classroom policies and guidance are written to the Plus edition.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project provides guidance and capabilities to secure agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments. The SCuBA Secure Configuration Baselines (SCB) for Google Workspace (GWS) will help secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) information assets stored within GWS cloud environments through consistent, effective, modern, and manageable secure configurations.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for GWS help secure federal information assets stored within GWS cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable secure configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance with the knowledge that every organization has different threat models and risk tolerance. Non-governmental organizations may also find value in applying these baselines to reduce risks.

This baseline is based on Google documentation available at [Google Workspace Admin Help: Classroom](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/?hl=en#topic=10298088) and addresses the following:

-   [Class Membership](#1-class-membership)
-   [Classroom API](#2-classroom-api)
-   [Roster Import](#3-roster-import)
-   [Student Unenrollment](#4-student-unenrollment)
-   [Class Creation](#5-class-creation)

Settings can be assigned to certain users within Google Workspace through organizational units, configuration groups, or individually. Before changing a setting, the user can select the organizational unit, configuration group, or individual users to which they want to apply changes.

# Baseline Policies

## 1. Class Membership

This section covers who has the ability to join classes and what classes the users in your domain can join.

### Policy

#### GWS.CLASSROOM.1.1v0.3
Who can join classes in your domain SHALL be set to Users in your domain only.

- _Rationale:_ Classes can contain private or otherwise sensitive information. Restricting classes to users in your domain helps prevent data leakage resulting from unauthorized classroom access.

  - [T1537: Transfer Data to Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537/)

#### GWS.CLASSROOM.1.2v0.3
Which classes users in your domain can join SHALL be set to Classes in your domain only.

- _Rationale:_ Allowing users to join a class from outside your domain could allow for data to be exfiltrated to entities outside the control of the organization creating a significant security risk.

## 2. Classroom API

This section covers policies related to the Google Classroom API.

### Policy

#### GWS.CLASSROOM.2.1v0.3
Users SHALL NOT be able to authorize apps to access their Google Classroom data.

- _Rationale:_ Allowing ordinary users to authorize apps to have access to classroom data opens a possibility for data loss. Allowing only admins to authorize apps reduces this risk.

## 3. Roster Import

This section covers policies related to importing rosters from Clever.

### Policy

#### GWS.CLASSROOM.3.1v0.3
Roster import with Clever SHOULD be turned off.

- _Rationale:_ If your organization does not use Clever, allowing roster imports could create a way for unauthorized data to be inputted into your organization's environment. If your organization does use Clever, then roster imports may be enabled.

## 4. Student Unenrollment

This section covers policies related to unenrolling a student from a class.

### Policy

#### GWS.CLASSROOM.4.1v0.3
Only teachers SHALL be allowed to unenroll students from classes.

- _Rationale:_ Allowing students to unenroll themselves creates the opportunity for data loss or other inconsistencies, especially for K-12 classrooms. Restricting this ability to teachers mitigates this risk.

### Prerequisites

#### GWS.CLASSROOM.4.1v0.3 Instructions
1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Apps** -\> **Additional Google Service** -\> **Classroom**.
3.  Select **Student unenrollment**.
4.  Select **Teachers Only**.
5.  Select **Save**.

## 5. Class Creation

The first time users sign in to Classroom, they self-identify as either a student or teacher. Users who identify as teachers will be marked as a pending teacher until an administrator verifies them. Google Classroom allows administrators to restrict class creation to only verified teachers.

### Policy

#### GWS.CLASSROOM.5.1v0.3
Class creation SHALL be restricted to verified teachers only.

- _Rationale:_ Allowing pending teachers to create classes potentially allows students to impersonate teachers and exploit the trusted relationship between teacher and student, e.g., to phish sensitive information from the students. Restricting class creation to verified teachers reduces this risk.
