# This package is used for software development and is not needed by
# the Scubagoggles users:
build

# There are many Python versions for users to install for ScubaGoggles, and
# because of this, it is too restrictive to limit versions of the dependent
# packages to an exact version (using ==).  One package version might not be
# available in a version of Python, but a subsequent package version is
# and will work just fine.  We have already run into user support issues
# because of this.  By requiring a minimum version (using >=), we
# are requiring a version that we support and any subsequent version - this
# gives users much more flexibility in their Python environments.
#
# Any changes to this package dependency list MUST also be reflected in the
# pyproject.toml file.
#
# These packages are the minimum required versions for running Scubagoggles:
