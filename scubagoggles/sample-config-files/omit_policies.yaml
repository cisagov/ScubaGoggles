# YAML configuration demonstrating omitting policies from ScubaGoggles evaluation.
# Any omitted policies should be carefully considered and documented as part of an
# organization's cybersecurity risk management program process and practices.

baselines: [gmail, chat, drive]

omitpolicy:
  GWS.GMAIL.3.1v0.3:
    rationale: "Known false positive; our SPF policy currently cannot to be retrieved via ScubaGoggles due to a split
      horizon setup but is available publicly."
    expiration: "2023-12-31"
  GWS.CHAT.5.1v0.3:
    rationale: &DLPRationale "The DLP capability required by the baselines is implemented by third party product, [x],
      which ScubaGoggles does not have the ability to check."
  GWS.DRIVEDOCS.7.1v0.3:
    rationale: *DLPRationale

# The "&" character used in the above example defines an anchor, which saves a value
# for future reference. This value can then be retrieved with the "*" character. See
# https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#692-node-anchors for more details. In this case, the
# anchor allows you to configure multiple omissions that share the same rationale
# without repeating yourself.
