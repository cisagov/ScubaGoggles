# CISA Google Workspace Secure Configuration Baseline for Google Gemini

Google Gemini is Googleâ€™s AI platform to assist with several tasks in Gmail, Drive, Docs, and Meet. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen Gemini security.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project, run by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), provides guidance and capabilities to secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for GWS help secure federal information assets stored within GWS cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance. Organizations outside of the Federal Government may also find these baselines to be useful references to help reduce risks even if such organizations have different risk tolerances or face different threats.

For non-Federal users, the information in this document is being provided "as is" for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. CISA does not endorse any commercial product or service, including any subjects of analysis. Any reference to specific commercial entities or commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation, or favoritism by CISA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, some controls and settings are not available in all products; CISA has no control over vendor changes to products offerings or features. Accordingly, these SCuBA SCBs for GWS may not be applicable to the products available to you. This document does not address, ensure compliance with, or supersede any law, regulation, or other authority. Entities are responsible for complying with any recordkeeping, privacy, and other laws that may apply to the use of technology. This document is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit for anyone against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

This baseline is based on Google documentation available at [Google Workspace Admin Help: Gemini for Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/topic/13853688?hl=en&ref_topic=9197&sjid=1480967616439197109-NA) and addresses the following:

-   [Gemini App Access](#1-gemini-app-access)
-   [Alpha Gemini features](#2-alpha-gemini-features)

## Assumptions

This document assumes the organization is using GWS Enterprise Plus.

This document does not address, ensure compliance with, or supersede any law, regulation, or other authority.  Entities are responsible for complying with any recordkeeping, privacy, and other laws that may apply to the use of technology.

## Key Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Baseline Policies

## 1. Gemini App Access
Data for users with a license that provides access to Gemini under the Google Workspace
or Workspace for Education terms cannot be used by Google for training generative
AI models. However, Google Workspace supports enabling access to Gemini, regardless
of license; only Gemini data for users with the appropriate license will be protected
by the Google Workspace Terms of Service.

Note that Gemini access to Google services outside of the Google Workspace core
services can be restricted in the admin center. These additional services
are not covered by the Google Workspace agreement and as such, could represent
some risk to user data. However, allowing Gemini access to those apps does not
increase that risk as those apps cannot access data from Gemini. See
[Additional Google Services](https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGoggles/blob/main/scubagoggles/baselines/commoncontrols.md#16-additional-google-services)
for more details on configuring these additional services.

### Policies

#### GWS.GEMINI.1.1v0.5
Gemini app user access SHALL be set to OFF for everyone without a license.

- _Rationale:_ Only Gemini data for users with the appropriate license will be
protected by the Google Workspace Terms of Service. Data for users without the
appropriate license can be used to improve Google's generative AI models; as such,
allowing user access to Gemini under any license creates the risk of data leakage.

### Prerequisites

-   None

### Implementation

#### GWS.GEMINI.1.1v0.5 Instructions
1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Generative AI** -\> **Gemini App**.
3.  Select **User Access**.
4.  Ensure **Allow all users to access the Gemini app, regardless of license** is **Unchecked**.
5.  Select **Save**.


## 2. Alpha Gemini features
Google Workspace permits admins to restrict or enable access to Gemini Alpha features
before they're made generally available.

Note that Alpha features in Gemini are subject to the Pre-General Availability
Offering Terms (excluding Section 6.1(b)) of the Google Workspace Service
Specific Terms. Section 6.1(d) prohibits government customers from using live or
production data in connection with Pre-GA Offerings.

### Policies

#### GWS.GEMINI.2.1v0.5
Alpha Gemini features SHALL be disabled.

- _Rationale:_ Allowing access to alpha features may expose users to features that
have not yet been fully vetted and may still need to undergo robust testing to ensure
compliance with applicable security standards. Additionally, government customers are
prohibited from using production data with pre-GA offerings, per the Google Workspace
Service Specific Terms.
