# CISA Google Workspace Secure Configuration Baseline for Common Controls

The Google Workspace (GWS) Admin console is the primary configuration hub for configuring and setting up the subscription. The scope of this document is to provide recommendations for setting up the subscription's security controls. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen the security of a GWS tenant.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project, run by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), provides guidance and capabilities to secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for GWS help secure federal information assets stored within GWS cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance. Organizations outside of the Federal Government may also find these baselines to be useful references to help reduce risks even if such organizations have different risk tolerances or face different threats.

## Assumptions

This document assumes the organization is using GWS Enterprise Plus. The Google Workspace (GWS) Common Controls Secure Configuration Baseline is unique among the GWS configuration baseline documents released by CISA in that it does not align to one specific GWS app. Implementers should be aware of this when cross-referencing the baseline statements to the live GWS admin console. Therefore, this document serves an enterprise-level compendium of implementable and testable configuration settings across the entire GWS admin console. The configurations specified herein correlate to the Security, Account, Directory, Rules, and Marketplace apps sections of the GWS admin console.

This document does not address, ensure compliance with, or supersede any law, regulation, or other authority.  Entities are responsible for complying with any recordkeeping, privacy, and other laws that may apply to the use of technology.  This document is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit for anyone against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

This Common Controls baseline document:

-   Assumes users are familiar with overarching Federal cyber guidance and cloud security fundamentals such as the shared responsibility model;
-   Accounts for recent direction from Executive Order 14028, the Federal Zero Trust Strategy (published as Office of Management & Budget Memo M-22-09 *Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles*), CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model, and the Federal Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture;
-   Observes industry guidance such as the Center for Internet Security's Google Workspace Foundations benchmark and Google official documentation and white papers; and
-   Was developed with input from both the Office of Management & Budget (OMB) and Google product managers and security engineers.

## Key Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

# Baseline Policies

## 1. Phishing-Resistant Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA), particularly phishing-resistant MFA, is a critical security control against attacks such as password spraying, password theft, and phishing. Adopting phishing-resistant MFA may take time, especially on mobile devices. Organizations must upgrade to a phishing-resistant MFA method as soon as possible to be compliant with OMB M-22-09 and this policy to address the critical security threat posed by modern phishing attacks.

This control recognizes federation as a viable option for phishing-resistant MFA and includes architectural considerations around on-premises and cloud-native identity federation in established Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) environments. Federation for GWS can be implemented via a cloud-native identity provider (IdP). Google's documentation acknowledges that on-premises Active Directory implementations may be predominant in environments that adopt GWS and provides guidance on the use of Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS) to synchronize Google Account data with an established Microsoft Active Directory or LDAP server.

The following graphic illustrates the spectrum of MFA options and their relative strength, with phishing resistant MFA (per OMB Memo 22-09) being the mandated method.
Please note there is a distinction between Google 2 Step Verification (2SV) and MFA as a general term. While FIDO Security Key and Phone as a Security Key are acceptable forms of Phishing-Resistant MFA which rely on Google 2SV as the underlying mechanism, the other forms listed in the "strongest" column do not use Google
2SV but are still acceptable forms of Phishing-Resistant MFA.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.1.1v1
Phishing-Resistant MFA SHALL be required for all users.


        > Phishing-resistant methods:

            - FIDO2 Security Key (directly in Google Workspace)

            - Phone as Security Key

            - FIDO2 Security Key (Federated from Identity Provider)

            - Federal Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card (Federated from agency Active Directory or other identity provider).

            - Google Passkeys

- _Rationale:_ Weaker forms of MFA do not protect against more sophisticated phishing attacks. Enforcing methods resistant to phishing reduces those risks. Additionally, phishing-resistant MFA is required for agency staff, contractors, and partners, by Office of Management and Budget Memo M-22-09.

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.1.2v1
If phishing-resistant MFA has not been enforced, an alternative MFA method SHALL be enforced for all users.

- _Rationale:_ This is a stopgap security policy to help protect the tenant if phishing-resistant MFA has not been enforced. This policy requires MFA enforcement, thus reducing single-form authentication risk.

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.1.4v1
Google 2SV new user enrollment period SHALL be set to at least 1 day or at most 1 week.

- _Rationale:_ Enrollment must be enforced within a reasonable timeframe. 1 week balances the need for allowing new personnel time to set up their authentication methods and reducing the risks inherent to not enforcing MFA immediately.

## 2. Context-aware Access

Device-based context-aware access provides access control policies based on device disposition attributes such as compliance with organizational secure configuration policies for devices (e.g., managed by Unified Endpoint Management). GWS also provides other context-aware access policies based on authentication and network information. These can be used to implement more targeted access policies. For advanced use cases, custom context aware access rules can be authored using the Common Expressions Language (CEL).

Device-based context-aware access can be used in several ways depending on agency business requirements. The following options are all acceptable approaches:

-   Properties of the device as reported by Google (encryption, screen lock, OS version, etc.)
-   Device inventory status (corporate-issued versus BYOD)
-   Use of Managed Chrome Browser
-   Data based on integration with certain third-party device management tools

It is extremely important to know how context-aware access policies affect one another, for example:

-   At a given scope (e.g., Organizational Unit [OU] or Group), each context aware access rule is evaluated separately. If any rule grants access, then access is allowed to the given application.
-   If rules are applied to OUs and Groups, which allow an action that may be denied after evaluating a policy at a higher level, then access will be allowed.

To enforce a device policy that requires company-owned devices, Google needs a list of serial numbers for company-owned devices.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.2.1v1
Policies restricting access to GWS based on signals about enterprise devices SHOULD be implemented.

- _Rationale:_ Granular device access control afforded by context-aware access is in alignment with Federal zero trust strategy and principles. Context-aware access can help to increase the security of your GWS data by allowing you to restrict access to certain applications or services based on user/device attributes.
- _Last modified:_ July 2023
- _Note:_ More granular controls may be used if the agency needs it.

### Prerequisites

-   One or more of the following user roles should have been configured to set context-aware policies:

        > Super admin

        > Delegated admin with each of these privileges:

                - Data Security -\> Access level management

                - Data Security -\> Rule management

                - Admin API Privileges -\> Groups\>Read

                - Admin API Privileges -\> Users\>Read

-   Serial numbers may be required to enforce a policy for company-owned devices. Refer to [Google documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10287358) on device management for additional guidance.

### Implementation

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.2.1v1 Instructions
To turn on Context-Aware Access:

1.  Access the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/).
2.  From the menu, go to **Security** -\> **Access and data control** -\> **Context-Aware Access**.
3.  Verify **Context-Aware Access** is **ON for everyone**. If not, click **Turn On**.
4.  Select **Access Level** and select **Create Access Level** and determine the conditions of the rule per agency needs.
5.  Select **Assign access levels to apps** and select Apps to apply the rule onto.

Note that the implementation details of context-aware access use cases will vary per agency. Refer to [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12643733) on implementing context-aware access for your specific use cases. Common use cases include:
-   Require company-owned on desktop but not on mobile device
-   Require basic device security
-   Allow access to contractors only through the corporate network
-   Block access from known hijacker IP addresses
-   Allow or disallow access from specific locations
-   Use nested access levels instead of selecting multiple access levels during assignment

## 3. Login Challenges
Login challenges are additional security measures used to verify a user's identity, including post-SSO verification.

Post-SSO verification controls what additional checks are performed (e.g., Google 2SV) after a user succesfully authenticates through a third-party identity provider.
SSO is managed through profiles, which can be assigned org-wide or to specific org units/groups.
Google Workspace handles post-SSO verification for profiles assigned org-wide as a separate case, allowing users more granual control of when post-SSO verification requirements apply.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.3.1v1
Post-SSO verification SHOULD be enabled for users signing in using the SSO profile for your organization.

- _Rationale:_ Without enabling post-SSO verification, any Google 2-Step Verification (2SV) configuration is ignored for third-party SSO users. Enabling post-SSO verification will apply 2SV verification policies.

### Implementation

#### Policy Group 3 Common Instructions
1.  Sign in to [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com) as an administrator.
2.  Select **Security**-\>**Authentication**-\>**Login challenges**.
3.  Under **Organizational units**, ensure that the name for the entire organization is selected.
4.  Click **Post-SSO verification**.

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.3.1v1 Instructions
1. For **Settings for users signing in using the SSO profile for your organization**, select **Ask users for additional verifications from Google if a sign-in looks suspicious, and always apply 2-Step Verification policies (if configured)**.
2. Click **SAVE**.

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.3.2v1 Instructions
1. For **Settings for users signing in using other SSO profiles**, select **Ask users for additional verifications from Google if a sign-in looks suspicious, and always apply 2-Step Verification policies (if configured)**.
2. Click **SAVE**.

## 4. User Session Duration

This control allows configuring of limits on how long a GWS session can be active before being prompted for authentication credentials.

Note: If using a third-party IdP, and agency-set web session lengths for its users, then there will be a need to set the IdP session length parameter to expire before the Google session expires to ensure users are forced to sign in again. See [GWS documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7576830) for additional details.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.4.1v1
Users SHALL be forced to re-authenticate after an established 12-hour GWS login session has expired.

- _Rationale:_ Allowing sessions to persist indefinitely allows users to bypass 2-Step Verification for future activity on that device. Limiting sessions to 12 hours may reduce the impact of session hijacking attacks and prevent users from inadvertently remaining logged in on unattended devices.

### Implementation

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.4.1v1 Instructions
To configure Google session control:

1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com) as an administrator.
2.  Select **Security.**
3.  Select **Access and data control** -\> **Google session control.**
4.  Look for the **Web session duration** heading.
5.  Set the duration to **12 hours.**

## 5. Secure Passwords

Per NIST 800-63 and OMB M-22-09, ensure that user passwords do not expire and that long passwords are chosen. Research indicates that frequent password rotation breeds poor password choice and encourages password reuse. Ensure that passwords are strong to defend against brute-force attacks. Ensure that passwords are not reused to defend against credential theft.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.5.1v1
User password strength SHALL be enforced.

- _Rationale:_ Weak passwords increase the risk of account compromise. Enforcing password strength adds an additional layer of defense, reducing the risk of account compromise.
 Strong password policies protect an organization by prohibiting the use of weak passwords.

## 6. Privileged Accounts

Administrative or admin accounts are privileged accounts in Google Workspace that can manage settings, access sensitive data, and perform critical functions. The compromise of an admin account could have catastrophic impacts on the workspace organization. This section defines privileged accounts as both pre-built and custom admin accounts.

Some examples of these privileged accounts include the pre-built GWS Admin Roles:

-   Super Admin: This role possesses critical control over the entire GWS structure. It has access to all features in the Admin Console and Admin API and can manage every aspect of agency GWS accounts.
-   User Management Admin: This account has rights to add, remove, and delete normal users in addition to managing all user passwords, security settings, and other management tasks that make it potentially crucial if compromised.
-   Services Admin: This admin has full rights to turn on or off GWS services and security settings for these services (Gmail, Drive, Voice, etc.). Given that most GWS features are premised on these services being secure, compromise of this account would be critical.
-   Mobile Admin: This admin has full rights to manage all the agency mobile devices including authorizing their use and controlling the apps that can be downloaded and used on them. This admin can also set the security policies on all agency mobile devices connected to GWS.
-   Groups Admin: This admin has full rights to view profiles in the organizational and OU structures and can manage all rights for those members in the group.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.6.1v1
All administrative accounts SHALL leverage Google Account authentication with phishing-resistant MFA and not the agency's authoritative on-premises or federated identity system.

- _Rationale:_ Leveraging Google Account authentication with phishing resistant MFA for highly privileged accounts reduces the risks associated with a compromise of on-premises federation infrastructure. This makes it more challenging for an adversary to pivot from a compromised on-premises environment to the cloud with privileged access.

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.6.2v1
A minimum of **two** and maximum of **eight** separate and distinct super admin users SHALL be configured.

- _Rationale:_ The super admin role provides unfettered access to the workspace. Properly managing the number of users with this level of access makes workspace compromise more challenging. However, having too few accounts can be problematic as it increases the risk of losing admin access entirely (e.g., if a super admin forgets their password); having between 2 and 4 balances these two concerns.
- _Last modified:_ July 2023
- _Note:_ Admin count does not include "break-glass" super admin accounts.

### Prerequisites

-   Super admin users cannot log in to admin.google.com with a third-party IdP when using super admin level accounts—they must use Google Login as the authentication mechanism. This policy extends this rule to other admin types.
-   Delegated accounts, including the ones defined as highly privileged above, can by default, use a third-party IdP to access admin.google.com: however, this policy prohibits that practice. All highly privileged accounts must use phishing resistant Google Authentication.

### Implementation

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.6.1v1 Instructions
1.  Determine how to track highly privileged accounts. For example, create an OU or group containing all highly privileged accounts.
2.  Follow the instructions on [Set up SSO for your organization](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12032922?hl=en), under "Decide which users should use SSO." For all OUs or groups with highly privileged users, set the **SSO profile assignment** to **None**.

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.6.2v1 Instructions
To obtain a list of all GWS Super Admins:

1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com) as an administrator.
2.  Navigate to **Account** -\> **Admin Roles**.
3.  Click the **Super Admin** role in the list of roles
4.  The subsequent dialog provides a list of Super Admins.

## 7. Conflicting Account Management

It is possible for employees of an organization to create conflicting, unmanaged accounts that are unmanaged by an enterprise's Google Workspace tenant. Unmanaged accounts are defined as users who independently created a Google account using the organization's domain. For example, a user with an enterprise/corporate email of user@company.com could create a personal, unmanaged Google account using that email address. This would create an account conflict in a GWS tenant licensed to company.com since email addresses are unique.

Creating a conflicting account can also happen unintentionally. After signing up for Google Cloud Identity or Google Workspace, admins might decide to set up single sign-on with an external identity provider (IdP) such as Azure Active Directory (AD) or Active Directory. When configured, the external IdP might automatically create accounts in Cloud Identity or Google Workspace for all users for which single sign-on was enabled, inadvertently creating conflicting accounts.

Unmanaged accounts carry significant risk, as they cannot be managed by admins, rendering them outside of the scope of protection admins can apply to keep work data secure. Significantly, two-step verification (2SV) cannot be enforced. Even if access is revoked, these accounts can carry a social engineering risk. Further, reconciling conflicting accounts creates churn for admins and adds to the workload of onboarding users to Google Workspace & Google Cloud.

The GWS admin console provides several administrative options for handling conflicting, unmanaged accounts:
  - Automatically invite users to transfer unmanaged accounts.
  - Replace unmanaged accounts with managed ones.
  - Don't create new accounts if unmanaged accounts exist.

This policy requires replacing unmanaged accounts with managed ones. When this option is configured, data owned by the account will not be imported; the user will receive a temporary account address, which they'll need to manually replace with a @gmail.com address of their choice; the user will receive an email notification of this and are informed they cannot use the original email any longer.

By changing the email address, the user resolves the conflict by ensuring that the managed account and consumer account have different identities. The result remains that they have one consumer account that has all their original data, and one managed account that doesn't have access to the original data.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.7.1v1
Account conflict management SHOULD be configured to replace conflicting unmanaged accounts with managed ones.

- _Rationale:_ Unmanaged user accounts cannot be controlled or monitored by workspace admins. By resolving conflicting accounts, you ensure all users in your workspace are using managed accounts.

## 8. Account Recovery Options

This section addresses the Google Workspace account self-recovery feature. When enabled, this feature allows users to add a recovery email or phone number with which they can reset their own accounts if needed, without needing to contact a workspace admin for support.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.8.1v1
Account self-recovery for super admins SHALL be disabled.

- _Rationale:_ If enabled, an adversary could attempt to gain access to a super admin account through the account recovery method. Disabling this feature forces super admins to contact another super admin to recover their account, making it more difficult for a potential adversary to compromise their account.

## 9. GWS Advanced Protection Program

This control enforces more secure protection of highly privileged, senior executive and sensitive users accounts from targeted attacks. It enforces optional GWS user security features like:

-   Strong authentication with security keys
-   Use of security codes with security keys
-   Restrictions on third-party access to account data
-   Deep Gmail scans
-   Google Safe Browsing protections in Chrome
-   Account recovery through admin

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.9.1v1
Highly privileged accounts SHALL be enrolled in the GWS Advanced Protection Program.

- _Rationale:_ Sophisticated phishing tactics can trick even the most savvy users into giving their sign-in credentials to attackers. Advanced Protection requires you to use a security key, which is a hardware device or special software on your phone used to verify your identity, to sign in to your Google Account. Unauthorized users won't be able to sign in without your security key, even if they have your username and password. The Advanced Protection Program includes a curated group of high-security policies that are applied to enrolled accounts. Additional policies may be added to the Advanced Protection Program to ensure the protections are current.

## 10. App Access to Google APIs

Agencies need to have a process in place to manage and control application access to GWS data. This control enables the ability to restrict access to Google Workspace APIs from other applications and is aimed at mitigating the significant cybersecurity risk posed by the potential compromise of OAuth tokens. The baseline policy statements are written to allow implementers to balance operational need with risk posed by granting app access.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.10.1v1
Agencies SHALL use GWS application access control policies to restrict access to all GWS services by third party apps.

- _Rationale:_ Third-party apps may include malicious content. Restricting app access to only apps trusted by the agency reduces the risk of allowing malicious apps to connect to the workspace.

## 11. Authorized Google Marketplace Apps

This section enables the ability to restrict the installation of Google Workspace Marketplace apps to a defined list provided and configured in the app allowlist. This guidance includes and applies to internally developed applications. This control disables legacy authentication and requires the use of modern authentication protocols based on federation for access from applications.

Some older versions of common software may break when this control is implemented. Examples of these apps include:
-   Mails configured with POP3
-   Older versions of Outlook

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.11.1v1
Only approved Google Workspace Marketplace applications SHALL be allowed for installation.

- _Rationale:_ Marketplace apps may include malicious content. Restricting app access to only apps trusted by the agency reduces the risk of allowing malicious apps to connect to the workspace.

## 12. Google Takeout Services for Users

This section prevents users from downloading a copy of the Google Takeout service's data to their user accounts. Services include Google Blogger, Books, Maps, Pay, Photos, Play, Play Console, Location History and YouTube, among numerous others.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.12.1v1
Google Takeout services SHALL be disabled.

- _Rationale:_ Google Takeout is a service that allows you to download a copy of your data stored within 40+ Google products and services, including data from Gmail, Drive, Photos, and Calendar. While there may be a valid use case for individuals to back up their data in non-enterprise settings, this feature represents considerable attack surface as a mass data exfiltration mechanism, particularly in enterprise settings where other backup mechanisms are likely in use.

## 14. Google Workspace Logs

Configure GWS to send critical logs to the agency's centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) so that they can be audited and queried. Configure GWS to send logs to a storage account and retain them for when incident response is needed.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.14.1v1
The following critical logs SHALL be sent to the agency's centralized SIEM.

        > Admin Audit logs

        > Enterprise Groups Audit logs

        > Login Audit logs

        > OAuth Token Audit logs

        > SAML Audit log

        > Context Aware Access logs

- _Rationale:_ This policy enhances security by centralizing critical logs in the agency's Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, enabling timely detection and response to potential security incidents. It also aids agency compliance with applicable law and binding policy and helps maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the agency's information systems.

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.14.2v1
Audit logs SHALL be maintained for at least 6 months in active storage and an additional 18 months in cold storage, as dictated by OMB M-21-31.

- _Rationale:_ Audit logs may be unavailable when needed if they are not retained for a sufficient time. Increased log retention time gives an agency the necessary visibility to investigate incidents that occurred some time ago.
- _Last modified:_ January 2024
- _Note:_ Google offers the ability to export certain logs to Google BiqQuery or Google Cloud log buckets, for an additional cost. Though these tools could be used to satisfy this baseline requirement, agencies are free to use the tool that best fits their individual circumstances.

### Prerequisites

-   None

### Implementation

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.14.1v1 Instructions
Follow the configuration instructions unique to the products and integration patterns at your organization to send the security logs to the security operations center for monitoring.

Note: Agencies can benefit from security detection capabilities offered by the CISA Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW) system. Agencies are urged to send the logs to CLAW. Contact CISA at [cyberliason@cisa.dhs.gov]

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.14.2v1 Instructions
1.  There is no implementation for this policy.

## 15. Data Regions and Storage

Google Workspace administrators can choose to store data in a specific geographic region (currently the United States or Europe) by using a data region policy. The policy can be applied to a specific organizational unit (OU) in a tenant or at the parent OU. For the interests of Federal agencies, the best practice is to restrict stored data for all users to the U.S. This means applying this setting at the parent OU. Data region storage covers the primary data-at-rest (including backups) for Google Workspace core services (see resources section for services in scope).

At the time of writing, data region policies cannot be applied to data types not specifically listed in documentation linked in the resources section. Notably, this includes logs and cached content.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.15.1v1
The data storage region SHALL be set to be the United States for all users in the agency's GWS environment.

- _Rationale_: Without this policy, data could be stored in various regions, potentially exposing it to unauthorized entities. Implementing this policy keeps most data in the U.S., making it harder for potential foreign adversaries to compromise the data.

## 16. Additional Google Services

Google Workspace considers some of its services "core services," including Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. Services outside of this core offering are controlled within the "Additional Google services" portion of the admin console. This section outlines requirements relating to those services.

### Policies

#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.16.1v1
Service status for Google services that do not have an individual control SHOULD be set to OFF for everyone.

- _Rationale_: Allowing access to additional google services without a need may create unnecessary vulnerabilities within the Google Workspace environment. By turning these services off, it mitigates the risk by not allowing access.

## 18. Data Loss Prevention

Using data loss prevention (DLP), organizations can create and apply rules to control the content that users can share in files outside the organization, which helps prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information.

DLP rules can use predefined content detectors to match PII (e.g., SSN), credentials (e.g., API keys), or specific document types (e.g., source code). Custom rules can also be applied based upon regex match or document labels.

There are several commercial DLP solutions available that document support for Google Workspace. Google itself offers DLP services. Agencies may select any service that fits their needs and meets the baseline requirements outlined in this policy group. The DLP solution selected by an agency should offer services comparable to those offered by Google.

Though use of Google's DLP solution is not strictly required, guidance for configuring Google's DLP solution can be found in the instructions of this policy section.

### Policies
#### GWS.COMMONCONTROLS.18.1v1
A custom policy SHALL be configured for Google Drive to protect PII and sensitive information as defined by the agency, blocking at a minimum: credit card numbers, U.S. Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN), and U.S. Social Security numbers (SSN).

- _Rationale:_ Users may inadvertently share sensitive information with others who should not have access to it. DLP policies provide a way for agencies to detect and prevent unauthorized disclosures.
