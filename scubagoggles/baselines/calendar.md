# CISA Google Workspace Secure Configuration Baseline for Google Calendar

Google Calendar is a calendar service in Google Workspace used for creating and editing events that enables collaboration amongst users. Calendar allows administrators to control and manage their sharing settings for both internal and external use. This Secure Configuration Baseline (SCB) provides specific policies to strengthen Calendar security.

The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project, run by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), provides guidance and capabilities to secure federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies' cloud business application environments and protect federal information that is created, accessed, shared, and stored in those environments.

The CISA SCuBA SCBs for GWS help secure federal information assets stored within GWS cloud business application environments through consistent, effective, and manageable security configurations. CISA created baselines tailored to the federal government's threats and risk tolerance. Organizations outside of the Federal Government may also find these baselines to be useful references to help reduce risks even if such organizations have different risk tolerances or face different threats.

For non-Federal users, the information in this document is being provided "as is" for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. CISA does not endorse any commercial product or service, including any subjects of analysis. Any reference to specific commercial entities or commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, recommendation, or favoritism by CISA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, some controls and settings are not available in all products; CISA has no control over vendor changes to products offerings or features. Accordingly, these SCuBA SCBs for GWS may not be applicable to the products available to you.

This baseline is based on Google documentation available at [Google Workspace Admin Help: Set Calendar sharing options](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60765?hl=en#zippy=%2Cset-a-default-for-internal-sharing%2Callow-or-restrict-external-sharing) and addresses the following:

-   [External Invitations Warnings](#2-external-invitations-warnings)
-   [Calendar Interop Management](#3-calendar-interop-management)
-   [Paid Appointments](#4-paid-appointments)

Settings can be assigned to certain users within Google Workspace through organizational units, configuration groups, or individually. Before changing a setting, the user can select the organizational unit, configuration group, or individual users to which they want to apply changes.

# Baseline Policies

## 1. External Sharing Options

This section determines what information is shared from calendars with external entities.

### Policies

#### GWS.CALENDAR.1.1v1
External Sharing Options for Primary Calendars SHALL be configured to "Only free/busy information (hide event details)."

- _Rationale:_ Calendars can contain private or otherwise sensitive information. Restricting calendar details to only free/busy information helps prevent data leakage by restricting the amount of information that is externally viewable when a user shares their calendar with someone external to your organization.

#### GWS.CALENDAR.1.2v1
External sharing options for secondary calendars SHALL be configured to "Only free/busy information (hide event details)."

- _Rationale:_ Calendars can contain private or otherwise sensitive information. Restricting calendar details to only free/busy information helps prevent data leakage by restricting the amount of information that is externally viewable when a user shares their calendar with someone external to your organization.

-   [CIS Google Workspace Foundations Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/google_workspace)

### Prerequisites

-   None

### Implementation

To configure the settings for External Sharing in Primary Calendar:

#### GWS.CALENDAR.1.1v1 Instructions
1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Apps** -\> **Google Workspace** -\> **Calendar**.
3.  Select **Sharing settings** -\> **External sharing options for primary calendars**.
4.  Select **Only free/busy information (hide event details)**.
5.  Select **Save**.

#### GWS.CALENDAR.1.2v1 Instructions

To configure the settings for External Sharing in secondary calendars:

1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Apps -\> Google Workspace -\> Calendar**.
3.  Select **General settings -\> External sharing options for secondary calendars**.
4.  Select **Only free/busy information (hide event details)**.
5.  Select **Save**.

## 2. External Invitations Warnings

This section determines whether users are warned when inviting one or more guests from outside of their domain.

### Policies

#### GWS.CALENDAR.2.1v1
External invitations warnings SHALL be enabled to prompt users before sending invitations.

- _Rationale:_ Users may inadvertently include external guests in calendar event invitations, potentially resulting in data leakage. Warning users when external participants are included can help reduce this risk.

### Prerequisites

-   None

### Implementation

#### GWS.CALENDAR.2.1v1 Instructions

To configure the settings for Confidential Mode:

1.  Sign in to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2.  Select **Apps** -\> **Google Workspace** -\> **Calendar**.
3.  Select **Sharing settings** -\> **External Invitations**.
4.  Check the **Warn users when inviting guests outside of the domain** checkbox.
5.  Select **Save**.

## 3. Calendar Interop Management

This section determines whether Microsoft Exchange and Google Calendar can be configured to work together to allow users in both systems to share their availability status so they can view each other's schedules. The availability and event information that will be shared between Exchange and Calendar include availability for users, group or team calendars, and calendar resources (such as meeting rooms). Calendar Interop respects event-level privacy settings from either Exchange or Calendar.

Due to the added complexity and attack surface associated with configuring Calendar Interop, it should be disabled in environments for which this capability is not necessary for agency mission fulfillment.

### Policies

#### GWS.CALENDAR.3.1v1
Calendar Interop SHOULD be disabled.

- _Rationale:_ Enabling Calendar interop adds a layer of complexity to Calendar management, possibly increasing the attack surface. Disabling this feature unless required by the organization conforms to the principle of least functionality.
- _Last modified:_ July 2023
- Notes
  - This policy applies unless agency mission fulfillment requires collaboration between users internal and external to an organization who use both Microsoft Exchange and Google Calendar

#### GWS.CALENDAR.3.2v1
OAuth 2.0 SHALL be used in lieu of basic authentication to establish connectivity between tenants or organizations in cases where Calendar Interop is deemed necessary for agency mission fulfillment.

- _Rationale:_ Basic authentication is a deprecated and risk-prone authentication method. Using OAuth 2.0 helps reduce the risk of credential compromise.
