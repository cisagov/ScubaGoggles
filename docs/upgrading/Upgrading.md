# Upgrading and Maintenance

## Upgrading ScubaGoggles

To upgrade ScubaGoggles to a newer version, you simply download the latest
[release package](../installation/DownloadAndInstall.md#downloading-the-latest-scubagoggles-release),
and [install](../installation/DownloadAndInstall.md#installing-scubagoggles)
it using Python's `pip` utility.  If you are using a Python virtual environment, make sure you have activated the virtual
environment before upgrading.

## Upgrading OPA

To upgrade the OPA executable, re-run the `scubagoggles getopa`
command, which will download the latest version to the directory
specified with `scubagoggles setup`.  You may also download a
particular version of OPA using the `--version` option.  See
[here](../installation/OPA.md) for details.
